# detector-calibration
This repository is for detector calibration at 26ID at APS at ANL, using powder diffraction data.
## Image notes:
The images are taken at E = 12 keV
Name of iamge: first number is sample to detector distance in mm, followed by 2theta and gamma in degrees.
cap_1 and cap_2 gives the reproducibility for the cap position
two 475_25_0 gives the reproducibility of the non-cap position
